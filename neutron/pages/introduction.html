Neutron is a plugin for enhancing ProtonMail security.
<p>
With this plugin, ProtonMail web interface is fixed to versions that are known
to be trustworthy(aka. without backdoors, if in the future anyone would attempt
to insert one for you). It also protects against insecure https connections,
making an attacker more difficult to spy on you.
