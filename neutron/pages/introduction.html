Neutron is a plugin for enhancing ProtonMail security.
<p>
With this plugin, ProtonMail web interface is frozen: scripts are fixed to
versions known to be trustworthy(i.e. without backdoors, if in the future
anyone would attempt to insert one for you). It also protects against insecure
https connections, making an attacker more difficult to spy on you.
