    NEUTRON: PROTONMAIL SECURITY ENHANCEMENT PLUGIN
    </span></div>
    <br />

    You are seeing this page as Neutron, your firefox plugin for ProtonMail
    security enhancement, has detected a problem in your connection to
    ProtonMail. Therefore all accesses are blocked.

    <br /><br /><br />

    This usually means the browser have regarded this connection as insecure,
    or an untrustworthy certifcate in building the connection is used, which
    is potentially dangerous.

    <p>

    Since it's highly impossible that ProtonMail has misconfigured its server,
    this error may indicate someone or device is trying to spy your
    connection.

    <p>
    You have been warned. You should NOT try to overcome this problem by
    disabling Neutron. Instead, access ProtonMail again with VPN or an
    encrypted proxy software, or use Tor Browser.
